# Global-Indian-GDP-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Objectives

This project focuses on analyzing global economic trends with a primary emphasis on India. An interactive dashboard is created to visualize GDP, GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, inflation, and sector-wise contributions over multiple years. The dashboard enables easy comparison between countries and helps derive meaningful economic insights.
